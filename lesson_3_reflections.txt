When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When my project also include some collaborators or i am contributing to project of some of my friend.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

if i am working on remote repository, a friend of mine made some changes and i am also doing some change and it should not conflict. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: When i want to get access to repository some one else on my own github and system.
Clone: When i want to add repository to my own system from github.
Branch: When i want to make different versions of same project with some changes.(Share to some one else and hide some of the features/files)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Whenever we want to trace back to the point where we were earlier means after pulling from the github, we can do this easily.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would prefer sharing through mails or dropbox. But github will be easier to use now.
