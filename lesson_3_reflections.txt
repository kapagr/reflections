When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When my project also include some collaborators or i am contributing to project of some of my friend.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

if i am working on remote repository, a friend of mine made some changes and i am also doing some change and it should not conflict.
