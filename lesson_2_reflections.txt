Ques: What happens when u initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans: When I initialize a repository using git init command, it crates a folder/directory called .git in my repository folder. And, that .git is a hidden file which i can access in git bash using command ls -a. It is needed to perform all the required git operations, version-control and cloning and sharing my work with my partners.

Ques: How is the staging area are different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans: Staging area is like cache and repository is like CPU and commit is any memory fetch operation. When we commit a file, it commits the file in the staging area first. Thus, if we have done some logical changes to only one or two files then it is good practice to put those files in the staging area and then git commit to commit those only files in the staging area. This is the main value it offers, i think.
